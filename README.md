The idea behind the Buddy group projects is to get you working in groups and collaborating together, in order to make a successful product at the end of the 8 weeks. The product should be a basic website without any backend, only frontend. We want you to showcase everything you have learnt so far but in a collaborative manner and working as a group. The website should be something that has a positive impact on society. Each person in the group should take on a specific role that they have researched and play that role during the 8 weeks in relation to your product i.e. since the product is front end only, you won’t need a back end developer.

Week 4 (3/12): During the PD session in week 4, you will get 20/25 mins to work in your groups to come to gather and work together. The task for this week is to prepare a professional document to pitch your idea to a stakeholder.

Week 5 (10/11): There will be no PD session next week, instead you will be presenting your MVP and everything you have researched over the past 4 weeks to the class. Each week you were asked to create some sort of slides or documents and you will now get a chance to present it all to your peers. Your presentation should have the following as a minimum

** Your understanding of different roles in tech
** What is agile - explain the 4 principles
** Tell us your idea for the project
** What did the decision making process look like in choosing  your final idea
** Any conflicts or issues that arrived and how you overcame them as a team.

From the 17th of December 2022 to the 21st of January 2023 (4 Saturday sessions include 2 week christmas break), you will work on this project during the PD sessions; you will spend the of the class time building your MVP with your team, and we will have some project related exercises.

Aman Singh's  annoucement on 16 Juanuary 202 on Slack:
quick announcement regarding your Buddy Group Presentations. The Presentations were supposed to be next week, the 21st of January, however, due to the classes being held online, we have decided to move all presentations to the 28th of January. Each team will have maximum 10 mins to present their Projects.Your presentation should cover the following:

    An explanation of what you have developed
    Discuss things that worked well within your team and what didn't work well? what would you do differently next time?
    What are some characteristics did you bring to the team and what are some things that you as an individual need to work on.
    What is the purpose of your product? Convince, inform, tell a story: Relate this to the global issue your team have chosen.
    Discuss two or three features you would add to the complete version but did not add to the MVP. What was the reasoning for not including them?

Remember to use an appropriate balance of presentation slides and spoken word.
